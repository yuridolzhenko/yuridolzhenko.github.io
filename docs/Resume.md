### _Summary_
Full stack developer with about 10 years of experience in designing, developing and maintaining software solutions for large international businesses.

### _Buzzwords_
Lots of Java and JVM languages on a backend. Legacy systems, monoliths, refactoring of those. RESTful APIs and microservices powered by Spring framework and others. Data centers on premises or AWS. A bit of data analytics using map-reduce, R and some other fancy tools. SQL or NOSQL databases - all may work, depending on a task to solve. Angular, Typescript, D3.js, Ext JS for creating modern user interfaces and single page applications. NPM, Bower, Maven, Gradle for managing dependencies and building things. Atlassian tools for managing projects and knowledge sharing. Git - for version control, Jenkins and GitLab for continuous integration and delivery, Docker - for portability and predictability. Sonar, JUnit, Mockito, Karma, Jasmine, Selenium to make sure things are reliable. Reactive and functional programming for efficiency and performance. Agile, scrum and devops for making this list complete.

### _Experience_
- **2017 - present**, LinkIT, ([http://www.linkit.nl][1]), The Netherlands
	_Consultant_
	I joined LinkIT, another consultancy company, in may of 2017 to join an efforts to transform a classic consultancy bureau into something else. Also
	my assignment as a consultant here is at Randstad, where we help the company with migration to AWS cloud and other challenges that many big companies are struggling with nowadays.

- **2014 - 2017**, ING, ([http://www.ing.nl][2]), The Netherlands
	_Consultant_
	As a consultant I joined ING bank’s teams to help them with their brand new omni-channel initiative (basically same API endpoints serving data for all channels, from self-service portals for private and business customers to call centers and bank’ branches). RESTful APIs that we were building (Spring and Jersey backed) for us are bridges between Angular JS frontends and TIBCO infrastructure (to which we connected through Netflix’ Hystrix), which actually has access to all of the bank’ datasources. I’m part of one of many _agile_ (Yaaay! Agile and scrum are now everywhere, so you can even become a _certified_ scrum team.) feature-teams consisted of product owner, frontend, backend and tibco developers (typically around 5-9 people), so we can develop our pieces of functionality independently (well, relatively). Besides developing APIs themselves, I’m also working on actual frontends that consume data from thoose. While mainly I’m busy with developing and delivering of the old and new functionality, I also started to make a presentations about our APIs ecosystem and guide newcomers, so they can get on track quickly.

- **2014 - 2017**, Qualogy, ([http://www.qualogy.nl][2]), The Netherlands
	_Consultant_
	After three years of working on the same type datasources of products, I felt like I have to do something else, so I started to work for Qualogy as a consultant in 2014 to have an opportunity to work for different companies and solve different problems.

-  **2011 - 2014**, Secondfloor ([www.secondfloor.com][3]), The Netherlands
	_Java developer_
	I had never thought about moving to the Netherlands, but today you never know where you will end up tomorrow. One of many Dutch recruitment companies reached me at LinkedIn and asked if I was interested in having an interview with one of theirs clients. «Why not?» - I replied. After a couple of talks I found myself packing stuff and moving to Amsterdam. Company that I started working for, was all about risk management, reporting and compliance tools for insurance and finance companies. There I was working on a product, jointly created by us and IBM (requirements were coming from IBM, we were working on the implementation, while IBM was selling the final product to their customers). It was a tool that was used for collection of structured and unstructured data, for reporting and decision making. Application was Spring-backed (MVC, security, JMS) and connected to Oracle or DB2 databases (using Hibernate for the most things and JDBC for some of them). It exposed a RESTful APIs for third-parties and for our own frontend that was built using Ext JS. We had a team of one project manager who did all the planning, three to seven developers to actually develop what was planned, couple of testers to test things and business analyst who was busy with writing specifications together with analysts from IBM. I was working on both backend and frontend parts of the application and busy with delivering binaries, fixing issues that came from testers in our test environments and supporting clients and real production systems.

-  **2009-2011**, Luxoft ([http://www.luxoft.ru/][4]), Russia
	_Senior java developer, lead java developer_
	Luxoft is one the biggest IT consultancy companies in eastern Europe, with the huge portfolio of clients, including Boeing, Deutsche Bank and UBS. I failed first interview there when I first came to Moscow and I succeeded one year later. I joined one of the many dev teams that company had on-site at UBS bank. We worked on application that was effectively a frontend to multiple bank's datasources that contained information about financial instruments. It was used for CRUD operations on the latter (including cross-datasource operations, i.e. querying an object in one datasource and saving it in another). We had to replace old swing-based desktop solution that had performance issues with the new, intranet-based one (spring mvc, with freemarker templates and Jquery / Jquery UI on the frontend). Being a truly software company in Luxoft we made use of most techniques and tools that were available and popular to use to support our work, Jira for issues tracking, Confluence for knowledge keeping and Bamboo for CI, and that was the time, when agile and scrum just started to get its hype, so our daily catch up instantly became scrum meetings, during which we could only stand! We had four developers (all in Moscow), testing team in Bangalore and product owner in Boston. We maintained and supported four instances of the application in four different time zones and that guaranteed us lots of fun when it came to communication: catch up calls/meetings in the evenings because of Boston's time zone,  and bunches of issues every morning because of Bangalore's time zone. While working on the project, my responsibilities grew from just developing of a new functionality and bug fixing to deploying releases to production, supporting customers and planning changes upfront.

-  **2008-2009**, Intouch Insurance ([http://www.in-touch.ru][5]), Russia
	_Java developer_
	
	I moved to Moscow in pursuit of career opportunities - there weren't many things to work on in my hometown. I immediately  joined in-house development team of "Intouch insurance", a pioneer company in online sales in Russia. Team was responsible for buidling and maintaining company's CRM system, which was based on [IDIT Insurance framework][6]. Application covered all the business processes that are typical for insurance company - policy sales, claims handling and payments management. We had a lot of new functionality to create while adopting framework to Russian insurance policies and laws (and twisted reality). We had a pretty much typical web application configuration for that time - JSP's, Struts servlets, Java EE's JDO to connect to Oracle database and a pinch of javascript on a frontend side. There I had my first experience of working in a distributed team - core framework team was located in Warsaw, Poland and we managed to work together efficiently and flexibly (no word "agile" was on horizon yet, though we used Jira) - teams sometimes traveled to each other, though daily things issues were communicated through emails and Skype good enough.

-  **2007-2008**, Rostelecom ([http://www.rostelecom.ru/][7]), Russia
	_Java developer_
	
	I started my career as a java developer in the biggest Russian telecommunications company. There I was working in a department responsible for a bunch of intranet applications used by company's different departments (HR, billing, etc). RPCs instead of RESTful APIs, Struts instead of Spring, pure JDBC instead of object-relational mapping tools, no continious deployment or delivery. No Jira, agile, test driven development or devops just yet, but we were responsible for everything starting from initial design to production deployment and supporting of our users.
